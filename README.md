# Thesis React application

This project was created in spring 2022. The purpose is to connect to
three different serverless backend API:s and test their functionality. Would they
be suitable for running a smaller serverless application?

## Available Links

At the moment this is a basic webpage with only three subpages.
- Home, login and about.

Login-page is now fetching token if login details are correct.

Fill in details about connection to the base url of the api in src/vars.js,
create a variable called baseUrl.

### Changes
2022-04-04 Basic React app created including routes using react-dom
2022-04-24 Login implemented, still need to save token for using in other routes
